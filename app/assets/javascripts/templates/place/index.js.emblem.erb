        span.placeholder I'm sad 'cause this part of this web page should not be empty, but nobody has told me
          what I should display here. Maybe nobody knows I exists ?
      p
        span.placeholder This makes me really, really sad. If I was a human, I would certainly call this place's
          owner, just to tell him that he has just to click on a button and fill a form. But I can't. The only
          thing I can do is waiting, for somebody who will do that for me.
      p
        span.placeholder So, please. If you know this guy. Tell him I'm waiting for his data. This will make me happy.
